### MiniShell

Welcome to my minishell! Here is a list of the availible commands:

- help - Displays all current commands. "help"
- cd - Changes current working directory. "cd /helloworld"
- execution - Can execute a program if shell is currently in the program's directory. "helloworld.exe"
- exit - Exits the shell. "exit"

To get started, clone or download the entire CS392 folder to get the necessary header files.

Then (assuming you're in a unix enviornment at this point) open your terminal and change into where you have saved CS392.

Make the executable:
```sh
$ make all
```

Start the minishell:
```sh
$ ./minishell
```

Enjoy!
