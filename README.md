### My Work In CS392 - Systems Programming

My work in this course has been broken down into four assignments. All of the programming for this course was done in C.

- minishell- My implementation of a shell! Can cd, dir, 'help', and execute files.
- minitalk - A basic chat room between server and clients.
- mylib - My own library of functions which are used in all other assignments.
- mylist - My implementation of a list and relevant list methods.

To get started, make sure you are running these in a unix enviornment. I recommend windows users download cygwin.
